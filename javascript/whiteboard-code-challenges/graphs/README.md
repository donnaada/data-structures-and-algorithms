# Challenge Title: Graphs Implementation

## Description

### Challenge 35

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- add vertex
- add edge
- get vertices
- get neighbors
- size

## Resources

Lecture Notes (Ryan Gallaway's 401d53 Class)

## Tests

### Run tests in terminal

- `cd` into `javascript/whitboard-code-challenges/stack-queue`
- run `npm test graph.test.js`

### Challenge 35 Tests

- Vertex can be successfully added to the graph
- An edge can be successfully added to the graph
- A collection of all vertices can be properly retrieved from the graph
- All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
- Neighbors are returned with the weight between vertices included
- The proper size is returned, representing the number of vertices in the graph
- A graph with only one vertex and edge can be properly returned

## Solution
