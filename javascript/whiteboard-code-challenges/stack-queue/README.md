# Challenge Title: Stacks and Queues Implementation

## Description

### Challenge 10

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Tests

### Run tests in terminal

- `cd` into `javascript/whitboard-code-challenges/stack-queue`
- run `npm test stack-queue.test.js`

### Challenge 10 Tests

- Can successfully push onto a stack
- Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
- Can successfully pop off the stack
- Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
- Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
- Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
- Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
- Can successfully enqueue into a queue
- Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
- Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
- Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
- Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
- Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
- Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
